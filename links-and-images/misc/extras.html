    HTML Entities
    </h2>
    
    <!--Entities always begin with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). In between, you put a special code that your 
    browser will interpret as a symbol. In this case, it interprets lt, gt, and amp as less-than, greater-than, and ampersand 
    symbols, respectively.-->
    <p>
    There are three reserved characters in HTML:  &lt; &gt; and &amp;.  You should always use HTML entities for these three characters.

    <p>If you&rsquo;re into &ldquo;web typography,&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll also find yourself using curly quotes quite a bit.</p>
