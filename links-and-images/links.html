<!-- ACCESSING PARENTS FOLDERS
    When you click either of those links in a web browser, it will complain that the page doesn’t exist. 
Examining the address bar, you’ll discover that the browser is trying to load misc/links.html and misc/images.html—
it’s looking in the wrong folder! That’s because our links are relative to the location of extras.html, 
which lives in the misc folder.
To fix this, we need the .. syntax. Two consecutive dots in a file path represent a pointer to the parent directory.
This is like saying, “I know extras.html is in the misc folder. Go up a folder and look for links.html and images.html in there.”
To navigate up through multiple directories, use multiple .. references, like so:
../../elsewhere.html
-->

<!-- The only difference between a root-relative link and a relative one is that the former starts with a forward slash. 
    That initial forward slash represents the root of your site. You can add more folders and files to the path after 
    that initial slash, just like relative links. The following path will work correctly no matter where the current 
    page is located (even in misc/extras.html)-->

        This particular page is about links!  There are three kinds of links:
        </p>
            
        <ul>
            <li>Absolute links, like to
            <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML' target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a 
            very good resource for web developers.</li>
            <li>Relative Links, like to our <a href='misc/extras.html'>extras page</a>.</li>
              
            <li>Root-relative links, like to our <a href='/'>home page</a> of our website, but those aren't useful to us right now.</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
